                                    <p>Ravi is an AI-powered architectural reviewer that acts like a senior architect on every pull request. Unlike other code reviewers that focus on code style or basic static analysis, Ravi understands your entire system architecture: database schemas, API contracts, data flow patterns, and business logic. It catches issues like N+1 queries, missing indexes, breaking API changes, and architectural inconsistencies that other tools miss because they lack context about your production system.</p>

This includes database table names, column schemas, indexes, foreign key relationships, row counts, and query execution plans. By combining this metadata with your code changes in real-time, Ravi can identify architectural issues like missing joins, inefficient queries, or schema mismatches without ever seeing or storing a single row of production data. All analysis happens during the PR review and nothing is retained afterward.</p>

                                    <p>No. Ravi integrates seamlessly into your existing GitHub pull request workflow.

                                    <p>No. Ravi's reviews run in parallel with your existing CI checks and typically complete within 2-3 minutes for most PRs. The system is designed to be non-blocking so engineers get feedback quickly while still in their development context. More importantly, Ravi focuses only on architectural and production-impacting issues, not style nitpicks, so the feedback is always actionable and worth the review time.</p>

                                    <p>Ravi adds value to teams of all sizes. Small teams benefit from having a senior architect's perspective on every PR without needing to hire expensive talent, preventing technical debt from accumulating early. Growing teams use Ravi to maintain code quality as they scale and onboard new engineers faster. Large organizations leverage Ravi to preserve institutional knowledge and ensure consistency across multiple teams and services. Architectural issues that slip through code review cost time and money regardless of your team size. Ravi catches them before they reach production.</p>

                                    <p>Ravi identifies architectural and performance issues that impact production systems: N+1 query patterns, missing database indexes, inefficient joins, breaking API changes, data consistency problems, security vulnerabilities in data access patterns, race conditions, improper error handling that could cause data loss, and schema migrations that might cause downtime.

                                    <p>Absolutely. Ravi excels at migration review by analyzing schema changes against your current database structure and codebase usage. It identifies issues like missing rollback strategies, operations that will lock tables during deployment, column removals that will break deployed code, and index additions that might time out on large tables. This prevents the common migration failures that cause production incidents.</p>
